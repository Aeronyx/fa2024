## Overview of the Course

This course is a Master’s level introduction to data science, focusing on proficiency in working with and
analyzing data. The course emphasizes practical skills in working with data, while introducing students to a
wide range of techniques that are commonly used in the analysis of data, such as clustering, classification,
regression, and network analysis. The goal of the class is to provide to students a hands-on understanding
of classical data analysis techniques and to develop proficiency in applying these techniques in a modern
programming language (Python).

Broadly speaking, the course breaks down into three main components, which we will take in order of
increasing complication: (a) unsupervised methods; (b) supervised methods; and (c) methods for structured
data.

Lectures will present the fundamentals of each technique; focus is not on the theoretical analysis of the
methods, but rather on helping students understand the practical settings in which these methods are useful.
Class discussion will study use cases and will go over relevant Python packages that will enable the students
to perform hands-on experiments with their data.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites: Students taking this class must have prior familiarity with programming, at the level of
DS110, CS105, CS108, or CS111, or equivalent. In this course you will use python – you are assumed
to either know python, or be ready to learn it quickly on your own in the first week. Linear Algebra – DS121
or CS132 or equivalent (MA 242, MA 442) – is required. DS210 or CS112 is also helpful.

## Learning Outcomes

Students who successfully complete this course will be proficient in data acquisition, manipulation, and
analysis. They will have good working knowledge of the most commonly used methods of clustering,
classification, and regression. They will also understand the efficiency issues and systems issues related to
working on very large datasets.

## Textbook and Slides
The textbook used in the course is published at [https://tools4ds.github.io/DS701-Course-Notes/](https://tools4ds.github.io/DS701-Course-Notes/).
This online text will evolve as the course progresses,
but I will work to keep it up-to-date.

The slides used in the lecture are actually executable Jupyter notebooks. When we show you code in lecture, it
will almost always be runnable code in the form of Jupyter notebooks which you can download and execute
on your own computer. You can modify them any way you’d like, play around with them, experiment, etc.
The notebooks and everything else I use in lecture are published on github. The repository is
[https://github.com/tools4ds/DS701-Course-Notes](https://tools4ds.github.io/DS701-Course-Notes/). If you want to clone
or fork the repository using git, please feel free. If you find a bug, feel free to submit a pull request.
Some of the lectures are based on Introduction to Data Mining, by Tan, Steinbach and Kumar. This is
a good place to go for more detail if some methodological aspect is not clear. For up-to-date reference on
Pandas, scikit-learn, or any of the other software tools we use, there is no substitute for online resources.
Google will quickly bring you to the authoritative (and current) references on software tools.

## Tools and Platforms

We will use:
1. Piazza for questions (URL TBD),
2. Github for homeworks, midterm and project submission,
3. Gradescope for grading and grade management, and
4. Kaggle for the midterm.

You should already be signed up for Gradescope (if not, enroll using code **TBD**). You can add
yourself to Piazza if you are not already enrolled.

You will need an account on Github. Once you have them, fill out the form
at **TBD** to let us know what it is.

If you don’t have an up to date Python installation, take care of that right away.

## Piazza

We will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is really well tuned to getting you help fast
and efficiently from classmates, the teaching fellows, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the
teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. Our class Piazza page is at: **TBD**. 
We may also use Piazza for distributing materials such as
homeworks and solutions.

When someone posts a question on Piazza, if you know the answer, please go ahead and post it. However
please don’t provide answers to homework questions on Piazza. It’s OK to tell people where to look to get
answers, or to correct mistakes; just don’t provide actual solutions to homework questions.

## Programming Environment

We will use python as the language for teaching and for assignments that require coding. Instructions for
installing and using Python are in the online textbook.

## Course and Grading Administration

Homeworks are due at midnight on the date shown on the syllabus. Assignments will be submitted using
github and gradescope. Please review the instructions for submitting homeworks, on the Resources
page of Piazza.

> NOTE: IMPORTANT: Late assignments WILL NOT be accepted. However, you may submit one homework
>up to 3 days late. You must email **TBD** before the deadline if you intend to submit a homework
>late.

Final grades will be computed based on the following:<br>
**20%** Midterm<br>
**40%** Homework assignments.<br>
**40%** Final Project<br>
The exact cutoffs for final grades will be determined after the class is complete.

## Homeworks

There will four homework assignments. In a typical assignment you will analyze one or more datasets using
the tools and techniques presented in class.

Homeworks will be submitted via github. For this, we need your github account (create one if
you don’t already have it). After you have created it, fill out the form at **TBD** to let us know what it is.
You are expected to work individually on homeworks.

## Midterm

The midterm will be a Kaggle Data Science competition among the students in the class with a live leaderboard.
Students will need to submit predictions based on a training dataset and a report detailing the methods
used and decisions made. Note that the intent is not to use the leaderboard to determine your grade, but rather
to help you assess how effective your work is. Accordingly, 80% of the grade will be based on the report
and only 20% will be based on the competition score related to the quality of the predictions made.

## Project

A major goal of this course is to gain experience with real-world data science problems in form of a project.
For the project you will extract some knowledge or conclusions from the analysis of dataset of your choice.
The analysis will be done using a subset of the methods we described in class.
Grading will be based on specific deliverables as well as your performance in your team throughout the
semester.

For the final project, students may get the opportunity to work with BU Spark! on a real world, datadriven
project for a company, non-profit, or institution. Spark projects have already been curated and will
be presented during “Pitch Day”. Project descriptions will be made available at the start of the semester.
Once every student has a final project, every team will need to upload a SCRUM file to the final project
repository every week which gives a short report on the status of their project.
SCRUM is an agile method used in many software companies. Fast and concise, it is a short report
answering the following questions:
* What have I worked on?
* What will I be working on next?
* Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?
* Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?

## Project Expectations
* All team members should contribute equally and proactively to project work; we will evaluate team
contributions through a peer evaluation at the end of the semester and this will be factored into your
grade.
* You / your team lead should make yourself available to speak with your client on a bi-weekly basis
(depends on client availability)
* You / your team lead should meet with your Spark PM on a weekly basis
* You should meet with your team every other day (can / should be a short meeting)
* For any team communication issues, please let your spark PMs know asap - they are here to help. If
the problem persists please email me with a description of the situation.
* All students are expected to abide by University conduct policies as detailed in the following links:
   * [Boston University Student Codes of Conduct](https://www.bu.edu/policies/policy-category/student-codes-condcut/)
   * [College of Arts & Sciences Codes of Conduct](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-conduct-code/resources-for-students/)
   * [Boston University Student Responsibilities](https://www.bu.edu/dos/policies/student-responsibilities/)
* All Spark! project teams
   – Project Managers: These are the project leads and will communicate with the client directly, they will assist with administrative support (meeting scheduling, agenda setting), and will be a point of contact for project questions / concerns. Project Managers are also responsible for
grading all Spark! project deliverables as detailed in the syllabus below. – Team Lead: These students will assist the Project Manager in attending client meetings, organizing team questions, and facilitating team meetings.
   – Team Members: These students work collaboratively with each other on the project goals. For details on what you must submit as part of your project, see the section “Project Deliverables” at the end of this syllabus.

## Spark! Collaboration

BU Spark! offers students an opportunity to work on technical projects provided by companies or organizations
in the Greater Boston area through our experiential learning lab (X-Lab). For this semester, Spark!
has partnered with DS701 to offer a diverse selection of external data science projects scoped to support the
course’s learning outcomes and enhance the student experience. To learn more about Spark!, please visit
their [website](https://www.bu.edu/spark/).

Your project team will be led by one of the Spark! Project managers. Their role is to support the student
team’s work plan, manage client communication and expectations, organize weekly and biweekly meetings,
and to oversee project deliverable grading.

Spark! projects are a great opportunity for students to get real-world project experience to highlight on
their github and CV. These projects have already been curated and will be presented during “Pitch Day”.
Project descriptions will be made available at the start of the semester.

## Academic Honesty

You may discuss homework assignments with classmates, but you are solely responsible for what you turn in.
Collaboration in the form of discussion is allowed, but all forms of cheating (copying parts of a classmate’s
assignment, plagiarism from books or old posted solutions) are NOT allowed. We – both teaching staff and
students – are expected to abide by the guidelines and rules of the Academic Code of Conduct (which is at
[http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/](http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/)).

Graduate students must also be aware of and abide by the GRS Academic Conduct
code at [http://www.bu.edu/cas/students/graduate/forms-policies-procedures/academic-discipline-procedures/](http://www.bu.edu/cas/students/graduate/forms-policies-procedures/academic-discipline-procedures/).

You can probably, if you try hard enough, find solutions for homework problems online. Given the
nature of the Internet, this is inevitable. Let me make a couple of comments about that:
1. If you are looking online for an answer because you don’t know how to start thinking about a problem,
talk to Ms. Lu or myself, who may be able to give you pointers to get you started. Piazza is great for
this – you can usually get an answer in an hour if not a few minutes.
2. If you are looking online for an answer because you want to see if your solution is correct, ask yourself
if there is some way to verify the solution yourself. Usually, there is. You will understand what you
have done much better if you do that. So ... it would be better to simply submit what you have at the
deadline (without going online to cheat) and plan to allocate more time for homeworks in the future.


_This syllabus provides a general plan for the course; deviations may be necessary depending on the progress of the class._
